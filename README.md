# Atrium-Safety-Board
 
 This project uses NodeJS, Javascript, and Pug to display some safety statistics about the plant.
 It updates in real time to represent changes to a database of statistics that is stored in a shared drive.

I stopped counting the generations so this is probably like the 7th gen of this app. Despite the simplicity, I ran into many problems throughout development. Mostly all problems stemmed from the fact that my company prevented me from downloading a proper installation of NodeJS which gave me SSL errors when trying to use API connections. On top of this, I was not given access to the necessary shared drive for many weeks. My problem solving skills were pushed to the max as I had to find solution after solution around the stupid road blocks that were put in front of me.
